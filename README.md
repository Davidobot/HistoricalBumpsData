# Historical Bumps Data 1827 - 1999

A dataset of records relating to the [Bumps](https://www.cucbc.org/bumps) rowing races (+ fun extras) at the University of Cambridge.

Currently sorted by club, with results for each day of racing. I am in the process of collecting the data, so will update as I get and clean the data.

End goal would be to have a neat interactive website showing all this with proper [bump charts](https://www.cucbc.org/bumps/results/22/3).
